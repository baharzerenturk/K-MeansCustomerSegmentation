## History of Project:
In this project, for an e-commerce site, we will segment customers based on potential returns from existing customers. We will do the segmentation with K-Means, which we have done with RFM metrics before.

## History of Dataset:
The dataset includes the sales of an online store between 2010-2011. The product catalog of this company includes souvenirs. It can also be considered as promotional products. There is also information that most of its customers are wholesalers.
